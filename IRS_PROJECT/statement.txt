### interaction interface ###



The "data_convert.py" is used to convert the interaction records into the form that matches the input of the algorithm.


### run the algorithm ###

Click the "bat" file, the algorithm would run and record the predict results in "result/metrics.txt" and "result/predict";

"metrics.txt" reports the overall performance of the algorithm on the given dataset;

"predict" records the predicted (user, item) pairs.


### display feedback to users through the feedback interface ###

The "web_crawler.py" is used to collect and storage the movie posters from the web;

The "view.py" is used to display (i) user's historical items in train data, (ii) predicted items and (iii) items in test data,
which are collect from the train file, the generated prediction file and the test file respectively. It's supported by a light
game engine and is designed for display the feedback interface for users.
